 * 
 * Input Format: An integer (salary) and a double (rating between 1 to 5).
 * Output Format: Incremented salary or invalid input message.
 * 
 * Sample Input: 10000 4.2
 * Sample Output: Incremented Salary is : 13000

 * Criteria:
 * 1–<3 → 10% increment
 * 3–<4 → 25% increment

/**
 * Jack has been interested in numerology for a while and has learned how to calculate a lucky number for a   * given word using the rules below:
 * Each alphabet in the word has an ASCII value (where 'A' = 65, 'B' = 66, ...,'Z' = 90, 'a' = 97, etc.).
 * Each letter in the word is assigned a 1-based index (i.e., the first letter has index 1, the second letter * index 2, and so on).
 * The lucky number is calculated as follows:
 * Multiply each character's ASCII value by its 1-based index.
 * Include this product in the sum only if either the index or the ASCII value (or both) are odd.
 * 
 * Example: Input 1: 5 and Input 2: JAMES
 * Output: 1126
